### Question 1

A mysterious benefactor offers to pay your bills for a year so you can work full-time on any programming project you want. What would you work on?

### Question 2

Same mysterious benefactor, same sweet deal, but this time you're asked to work on a _non_-programming project. What would you work on?

I would love to join a group of researchers to study the Colossal Squid. Even though I love outer space (I'm a space junkie), I feel like there are lots of places to explore in the deep oceans. Here is a fascinating TED talk about deep sea and bioluminescence for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=IThAD5yKrgE.

We are just beginning our understanding of the Colossal Squid in its natural habitat. One of the best interactions we've ever had with it can be seen in this short documentary: http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/discovering-the-giant-squid.htm. I'd love to help bring more understanding about this wonderful creature.
